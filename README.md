## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/beacon-career-chatbot.git
cd beacon-career-chatbot

# Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env       # fill in your config

# Start database services
docker-compose up -d

# Beacon — React onboarding

Six-screen login and profile flow.

## Quick start (demo — no database)

```bash
cd pathfinder-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — `DEMO_MODE` is **on** by default (see `src/config.js`). The UI does **not** call the backend until you turn demo off.

## Connect frontend to backend

See **[CONNECT_BACKEND.md](./CONNECT_BACKEND.md)** for the full step-by-step guide.

Short version:

1. Set up PostgreSQL + Redis and run the API (`pathfinder-backend-copy`).
2. In `src/config.js` set `DEMO_MODE = false`.
3. Restart `npm run dev`.

## Deploy

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.example.in npm run build
```

Upload the `dist/` folder to your web host.
