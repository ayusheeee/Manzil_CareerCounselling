  { q: "What is a Holland Code?", a: "A Holland Code is a 3-letter combination (like IAS or RCE) that represents your top 3 personality types from the RIASEC model. It is used worldwide to match people to careers that genuinely suit them." },
  { q: "How accurate is the RIASEC test?", a: "The RIASEC model was developed by psychologist John Holland and has been validated across decades of research. It is one of the most widely used career assessment frameworks in the world, used by universities, counsellors, and career platforms globally." },
  { q: "What if I don't agree with my result?", a: "Results reflect your answers at this moment. If something feels off, retake the test and answer as honestly as possible. Avoid choosing what you think sounds good — choose what genuinely feels like you. Your environment, mood, and recent experiences can also influence answers." },
  { q: "Can Class 10 students take this test?", a: "Absolutely. This test is designed for students in Class 10, 11, and 12 who are exploring streams and career options. Earlier is often better — it gives you more time to plan." },
  { q: "Will this tell me exactly what to do with my life?", a: "No — and no test can. This report gives you a strong, evidence-based starting point. Use it as a guide to explore, not a final verdict. The best career decisions come from a mix of self-awareness, real-world experience, and conversations with mentors." },
  { q: "Is my data stored anywhere?", a: "Your name and details only appear on your personalised report. We do not store, share, or sell your information. The test runs entirely in your browser and on our server during the session." },
  { q: "Can I share the report with my parents?", a: "Yes — and we encourage it. The report includes a section specifically written for parents to help them understand your personality type and how to support your career direction." },

                The RIASEC model — developed by psychologist <strong>John L. Holland</strong> — is one of the most widely researched and used career assessment frameworks in the world.
                It classifies personalities into six types: <strong>Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising,</strong> and <strong>Conventional</strong>.
              </p>
              <p className="section-body">
                This model is used by universities, career counsellors, and platforms across the globe — including the US Department of Labor's O*NET system — to help people identify careers that align with who they genuinely are.
                Your combination of these six types produces a <strong>Holland Code</strong> (e.g. IAS, RCE) which maps directly to careers, streams, and study pathways.
              </p>
              <p className="section-body">
                Unlike generic personality tests, RIASEC is designed specifically for career fit. It does not ask vague philosophical questions — it asks about activities, preferences, and work styles that directly correlate with real-world professions and industries.
