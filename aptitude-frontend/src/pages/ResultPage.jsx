  Realistic: "Your child is practical and hands-on — they learn best by doing, not by reading or theorising. They thrive when working with tools, systems, and tangible outcomes. Support them with workshops, technical hobbies, or mechanical projects. Engineering, technical fields, and applied sciences suit their personality. Avoid pressuring them into highly abstract or people-heavy roles unless they show genuine interest.",
  Artistic: "Your child is creative and expressive — they need freedom to imagine, design, and create. Rigid structures and rule-bound environments will drain them.

India's creative economy is growing rapidly — this is a legitimate, financially viable path.",
  Social: "Your child is empathetic and people-oriented — they are energised by helping others and building relationships. They will find meaning in careers that involve teaching, healing, counselling, or community work. Support them by valuing emotional intelligence as a real skill. Careers in education, healthcare, psychology, and social work suit them deeply. They may need encouragement to also pursue their own goals, not just others'.",
  Enterprising: "Your child is ambitious and naturally driven to lead. They thrive in challenging, fast-paced environments where they can take initiative and influence others. Support them by encouraging leadership roles, public speaking, and business thinking. Careers in business, law, entrepreneurship, and management suit them. They may take risks — guide them, but resist the urge to over-control their decisions.",
  Conventional: "Your child is precise, organised, and methodical — they excel at structure, accuracy, and consistency. They thrive in stable, well-defined environments. Support them by valuing their reliability and attention to detail. Careers in finance, accounting, administration, and data management align with their strengths. India has strong, secure career paths in these areas — your child is well-suited to them.",
